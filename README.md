🏢 **Project Title**: Plaza Simulation System

📚 **Description**:
The Plaza Simulation System is a C# application that simulates the operations of a plaza with different client types (sellers, eaters, and drinkers). The system is designed to demonstrate key software engineering concepts and best practices. It consists of a server component and client components that interact through RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

🔑 **Key Features**:
- 🖥️ **Server Component**: The server component represents the plaza's state and management. It exposes an RPC service contract that allows clients to interact with the plaza.

- 👥 **Client Components**: The client components simulate different types of clients (sellers, eaters, drinkers) who enter and leave the plaza based on the time of day. The clients use RPC to communicate with the server.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Client Transformation**: Clients can dynamically change their roles between sellers, eaters, and drinkers as the time changes, simulating realistic behavior.

- 📋 **Logging**: The system logs detailed information about client actions, changes in the plaza's state, and time-related events, which helps in debugging and monitoring.

📋 **Requirements**:
- C# (.NET Core)
- NLog for logging
- SimpleRpc for RPC communication
- Hyperion for data serialization
- Visual Studio (recommended) or any C# development environment

🚀 **Usage**:
1. 📦 Clone the repository.
2. 🏗️ Build and run the server and client components.
3. 👁️ Observe the plaza simulation as clients enter and exit based on time and roles.

🤝 **Contributing**:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to 📢 open issues, 🚀 suggest improvements, and 📦 submit pull requests to enhance the simulation system.
